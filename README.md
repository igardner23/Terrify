# Terrify


The general idea, is to take all the modern machine learning technology that is objectively pretty scary as is, and use selenium webdriver to emulate thousands and thousands of creepy clone accounts of people, with slightly modified faces and trained on their writing style to produce eerily realistic stylistic clones of what they say (Thanks GPT-2)

## The general idea, would be to run as many copies as possible on Halloween, and even prior to that, messaging one another as if they were them.

### The goal, is to get people to understand the kind of data they're putting out there on a continuous basis, and god I wish I could figure out how to convince them the people they are giving it to are NOT GOOD. Ugh.
